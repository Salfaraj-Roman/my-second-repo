    <p>Jalāl al-Dawla Mu'izz al-Dunyā Wa'l-Din Abu'l-Fatḥ ibn Alp Arslān (8 August 1055 – 19 November 1092, full name: Persian: سلطان جلال الدولہ معوذ الدنیا و الدین ملک شاه بن محمد الپ ارسلان قسیم [3]), better known by his regnal name of Malik-Shah I (Persian: ملک شاه, Turkish: Melikşah), was sultan of the Seljuk Empire from 1072 to 1092.</p>
    <div>
        <p>During his youth, he spent his time participating in the campaigns of his father Alp Arslan, along with the latters vizier Nizam al-Mulk. During one of such campaigns in 1072, Alp Arslan was fatally wounded and died only a few days later. After that, Malik-Shah was crowned as the new sultan of the empire, but the succession was contested by his uncle Qavurt. Although Malik-Shah was the nominal head of the Seljuk state, Nizam al-Mulk held near absolute power during his reign.[4] Malik-Shah spent the rest of his reign waging war against the Karakhanids on the eastern side, and establishing order in the Caucasus.</p>
        <p>Malik-Shah's death to this day remains under dispute; according to some scholars, he was poisoned by Abbasid caliph al-Muqtadi, while others say that he was poisoned by the supporters of Nizam al-Mulk.</p>
